Analysis of Car and Two wheeler pricing in the new and resale market segment

Final Summary of Insights

    Brand & Vehicle Type Matter: SUVs and sedans (Toyota, Hyundai) retain value better than budget hatchbacks, and the same trend is seen in two-wheelers.
    Diesel > Petrol > CNG in resale value (for cars).
    Purchase Price is the strongest numerical predictor of resale price.
    Age reduces value, but high-end models depreciate slower.
    Kilometers driven alone isn’t a strong predictor—context (age, brand) matters more.
    Automatics command a higher resale value in cars but a lower resale value in two-wheelers due to automatics being offered lesser in hatchbacks compared to gearless two wheelers, indicating a good market opportunity in selling automatic hatchbacks
